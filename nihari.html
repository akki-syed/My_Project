    <h1>nihari Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Nihari is a traditional South Asian dish, believed to have originated in the Mughal kitchens of Old Delhi during the late 18th century. The name "nihari" is derived from the Arabic word "nahar," meaning morning, as it was traditionally eaten as a breakfast dish after Fajr prayers. Nihari was a favorite among royal households and workers alike, prized for its rich, flavorful taste and ability to provide sustained energy for the day. Over time, the dish spread across the Indian subcontinent, gaining popularity in Pakistan and Bangladesh, where it remains a cherished comfort food.

<li>4-5 cups water</li>

<li>1 small cinnamon stick</li>


<li>2-3 green cardamom pods</li>
<li>1 black cardamom</li>
<li>1 tsp nutmeg powder</li>
<li>1 tsp mace powder</li>
<li>1 tbsp red chili powder</li>
<li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
<li>1 tsp garam masala powder</li>
<h2>For the Base:</h2>

<li>1/2 cup ghee (or oil)</li>
<li>2 medium onions, thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
<li>1/4 cup whole wheat flour or roasted gram flour (to thicken)</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<h2>For Garnish:</h2>

<li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
<li>Ginger juliennes</li>
<li>Green chilies, sliced</li>
<li>Lemon wedges</li>


    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Nihari Masala</h2>

<li>Dry roast fennel seeds, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom pods in a pan until fragrant.</li>
<li>Grind the roasted spices to a fine powder and mix with the remaining masala ingredients. Set aside.</li>
<h2>Step 2: Cook the Base</h2>

<li>Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker.</li>
<li>Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown.</li>
<li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute.</li>
<h2>Step 3: Add Meat and Masala</h2>

<li>Add the meat pieces and cook until lightly browned.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the prepared Nihari masala and mix well.</li>
<h2>Step 4: Simmer</h2>

<li>Add water, ensuring the meat is fully submerged. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a gentle simmer.</li>
<li>Cover and cook for 4-6 hours (or pressure cook for 40-60 minutes) until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.</li>
<h2>Step 5: Thicken the Gravy</h2>

<li>Mix the flour with a small amount of water to form a smooth slurry.</li>
<li>Gradually add the slurry to the pot, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.</li>
<li>Let it simmer until the gravy thickens to your desired consistency.</li>
<h2>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h2>

<li>Ladle the Nihari into bowls and garnish with fresh coriander, ginger juliennes, and green chilies.</li>
<li>Serve hot with naan, parathas, or steamed rice, along with lemon wedges.</li>
