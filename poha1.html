    <h1>poha Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Poha is a popular Indian breakfast dish made from flattened rice. It's light, quick to prepare, and can be made in a variety of ways with different regional variations. Known for its simplicity and versatility, Poha is enjoyed throughout India, especially in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
The history of Poha is deeply rooted in Indian food culture. Flattened rice, also known as beaten rice, has been used in India for centuries due to its ease of preparation, long shelf life, and portability. It's believed to have originated in ancient India and has been a staple in many Indian households. The dish itself has evolved over time, with different regions adding their unique flavors and ingredients.

Poha is thought to have been particularly popularized in Maharashtra, where it is often consumed for breakfast or as a light meal. The dish was traditionally made with minimal ingredients and served with tea or curd, and it became a common breakfast option because it is both nutritious and quick to prepare.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups poha (flattened rice)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon oil or ghee</li>
<li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>1-2 green chilies, chopped (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/4 cup peas (optional)</li>
<li>1/4 cup grated coconut (optional)</li>
<li>1/4 cup peanuts (roasted, optional)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon sugar (optional)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ginger, finely grated (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Poha</h2>
<li>Place the poha (flattened rice) in a sieve or large strainer. Rinse it gently under cold water for a few seconds to remove any dust or dirt. Be careful not to over-rinse, as it can become mushy.</li>
<li>Once rinsed, set the poha aside to drain and fluff it lightly with a fork to separate the grains. If you prefer your poha slightly moist, sprinkle a few drops of water on it and cover it with a lid to steam for a couple of minutes.</li>
<h2>Step 2: Cook the Poha</h2>
<li>Heat the oil or ghee in a large pan or wok over medium heat.</li>
<li>Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds to the pan. Let them crackle for a few seconds.</li>
<li>Add the chopped green chilies, grated ginger (if using), and onions. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onions become soft and translucent.</li>
<li>If you’re adding peas, peanuts, or any other vegetables, toss them in now and sauté for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Add turmeric powder, salt, and sugar (if using), and mix well.</li>
<li>Now, add the rinsed poha to the pan. Gently stir the poha to combine all the ingredients and ensure the spices are evenly distributed. Cook for 3-4 minutes on low heat, allowing the poha to warm through.</li>
<li>If the poha seems too dry, you can sprinkle a little water over it to steam it lightly.</li>
<h2>Step 3: Garnish and Serve</h2>
<li>Once cooked, squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the poha (optional) and mix.</li>
<li>Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves and, if you like, top with grated coconut and roasted peanuts.</li>
<li>Serve the poha hot, either on its own or with a side of yogurt or chutney.</li>
</ol>
