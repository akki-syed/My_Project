    <h1>ksheerannam Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Ksheerannam, often referred to as milk rice or sweet rice pudding, is a traditional Indian dish with deep roots in cultural, 
religious, and culinary history. This dish is particularly significant in South Indian traditions, 
where it is commonly prepared as an offering (naivedyam) to deities during rituals and festivals.
Ksheerannam derives its name from two Sanskrit words: Ksheera (milk) and Annam (rice). Its origins can be traced back to Vedic times when simple rice dishes were integral to daily meals and religious offerings.
Sweetened milk and rice preparations are mentioned in ancient texts like the Bhagavata Purana and Charaka Samhita, emphasizing their nourishing and auspicious nature.
Temple Tradition:

Ksheerannam is commonly prepared as prasadam (offering to deities) in temples, particularly in Vaishnavite traditions. It symbolizes purity, prosperity, and the divine connection between food and spirituality.
Variations of this dish are integral to major temples like Tirupati, where sweet rice dishes like paramannam are offered to Lord Venkateswara.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li> 1 cup rice (preferably basmati or sona masuri)</li>
     <li> 3 cups full-fat milk</li>
     <li> 1 cup water</li>
     <li> 1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
     <li> 1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
     <li> 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
     <li> 8-10 cashews</li>
     <li> 8-10 raisins</li>
     <li> A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
   </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
    <li>Wash the rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 15-20 minutes.</li>
<li>In a pan, add the soaked rice, 1 cup of water, and cook it until it's soft and fully cooked. You can also use a pressure cooker to cook the rice for about 2 whistles.</li>
<li>Prepare the Milk:</li>

<li>In another pan, bring the milk to a boil and simmer it on low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning. If you prefer a richer texture, you can boil the milk for longer.</li>
<li>Combine Rice and Milk:</li>

<li>Once the rice is cooked, add it to the boiling milk and mix well.</li>
<li>Let it simmer on low heat for about 10-15 minutes, so the rice absorbs the milk and becomes soft and creamy.</li>
<li>Add Sugar and Cardamom:</li>

<li>Add sugar to the rice-milk mixture and stir until it dissolves.</li>
<li>Sprinkle in cardamom powder and mix it into the ksheerannam for a fragrant flavor.</li>
<li>Garnish:</li>

<li>In a small pan, heat ghee and fry the cashews and raisins until they turn golden brown.</li>
<li>Add the fried cashews and raisins to the ksheerannam.</li>
<li.Optionally, you can add a few saffron strands soaked in warm water to enhance the flavor and color.</li>
<li>Serve:</li>

<li>Once everything is mixed well, serve the Ksheerannam warm or chilled, as per your preference.</li>
    </ol>
