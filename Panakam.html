    <h1>Panakam Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
     Panakam has its roots in ancient Indian traditions and is often associated with religious festivals, especially in Southern India. It is believed to have been a drink offered to Lord Rama during his times in the forest, as it is a simple, natural drink made with ingredients that were easily available. The drink symbolizes the simplicity and purity of the offerings made to the deity. In temples, it is typically distributed as prasadam (holy offering) to devotees during festivals like Sri Rama Navami.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1/2 cup jaggery (grated or in block form)</li>
        <li> 1 cup water (room temperature or chilled)</li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li> 2-3 cardamom pods (crushed)</li>
        <li> A pinch of salt (optional)</li>
        <li>Lemon juice (optional, for added tang)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Jaggery:</li>

<li>Grate or chop the jaggery into small pieces. You can use raw jaggery (gur) for an authentic taste, or you can use a jaggery syrup if you want a quicker preparation.</li.
<li>Dissolve the Jaggery:</li>

<li>In a bowl, add the grated jaggery and pour 1 cup of water over it. Stir the mixture well until the jaggery completely dissolves in the water.</li>
<li>Add the Flavors:</li>

<li>To the jaggery water, add the ground black pepper, grated ginger, crushed cardamom pods, and a pinch of salt (if using). These ingredients add a spicy-sweet and aromatic flavor to the drink.</li>
<li>Mix Well:</li>

<li>Stir the drink thoroughly, ensuring that the spices and jaggery are well combined with the water.</li>
<li>Optional - Add Lemon Juice:</li>

<li>If you prefer a tangy twist, you can add a few drops of lemon juice to the panakam. This is a common variation, though it's optional.</li>
<li>Chill and Serve:</li>

<li>Panakam is best served chilled. You can refrigerate it for a while before serving or serve it with ice cubes for a refreshing drink.</li>

    </ol>
