    <h1>Railway Mutton Curry Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Railway Mutton Curry is a flavorful and hearty dish that originated during the British colonial era in India, specifically created for the Indian Railways. This curry became popular among travelers, particularly on long train journeys, because it was a nutritious and filling meal that could withstand long hours of travel while still retaining its taste. Over time, it has evolved into a beloved dish in Indian cuisine, particularly in the northern and western regions, and is known for its rich, aromatic flavors.
The dish has its roots in the era of the British Raj, when the Indian Railways were introduced to ensure better connectivity across the country. The British would prepare special meals for the passengers, and the Railway Mutton Curry was one of the dishes served in the trains. The curry was often made using mutton, which was widely available in the country, and cooked in a rich gravy with a combination of spices. It was designed to be a flavorful, substantial meal that could be easily transported and served in a train kitchen.

Railway Mutton Curry became a part of the "railway cuisine" that developed around the travel needs of the time. The dish evolved over the years, incorporating regional variations, and is now enjoyed in households, restaurants, and even train journeys across India

<li>Cardamom pods: 2</li>
<li>Cumin seeds: 1 tsp</li>
<li>Coriander powder: 1 tbsp</li>
<li>Cumin powder: 1 tsp</li>
<li>Red chili powder: 1-2 tsp</li>
<li>Garam masala: 1 tsp</li>
<li>Turmeric powder: ½ tsp</li>
<li>Salt: To taste</li>

<li>Lemon juice: 1 tsp (optional, for a tangy kick)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <h2>Marinate the Mutton:</h2>

<li>In a bowl, combine the mutton pieces with yogurt, salt, and turmeric powder.</li> 
<li>Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (or longer for more flavor).</li>
<h2>Prepare the Spices:</h2>

<li>Heat oil in a pressure cooker or large pot. Add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom, and cumin seeds.</li>
<li>Sauté for a minute until they release their aroma.</li>
<h2>Cook the Onions and Tomatoes:</h2>

<li>Add the finely chopped onions to the pot and sauté them until golden brown. This will create a rich base for the curry.</li>
<li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, and sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
<li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and blend into the masala.</li>
<h2>Add the Ground Spices:</h2>

<li>Add the coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, and garam masala to the pot. </li>
<li>Stir well to coat the onions and tomatoes with the spices, and cook until the oil starts to separate from the masala.</li>
<h2>Cook the Mutton:</h2>

<li>Add the marinated mutton pieces to the pot and sear them until browned on all sides. This helps to lock in the flavors.</li>
<h2>Add Water or Stock:</h2>

<li>Pour in water or mutton stock to the pot, enough to cover the mutton pieces. Stir well, and bring it to a boil. </li>
<li>If using a pressure cooker, cover it and cook for 4-5 whistles or until the mutton is tender. </li>
<li>If using a regular pot, cover and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the mutton is cooked through and the gravy thickens.</li>
<h2>Garnish:</h2>

<li>Once the mutton is tender and the curry has reached the desired consistency, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add a squeeze of lemon juice for a tangy flavor.</li>
<li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
<h2>Serve:</h2>

<li>Railway Mutton Curry is traditionally served with naan, paratha, or steamed rice. It can also be paired with chapatis for a fulfilling meal.</li>
