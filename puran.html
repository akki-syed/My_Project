    <h1>puran poli Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>

Puran Poli is a traditional Indian flatbread stuffed with a sweet filling of chana dal (split chickpeas) and jaggery. It is especially popular in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and other parts of India, often prepared during festivals like Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, and Makar Sankranti.

Puran Poli has ancient roots, dating back to the time when food and rituals were closely intertwined in Indian culture. The dish is believed to have originated in Maharashtra and is a staple of Maharashtrian cuisine. Over time, it spread to other regions of India, adapting to local ingredients and tastes. It is known by different names in various regions, such as obattu in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and patholi in some parts of Kerala. Puran Poli is often made during festivals as it is considered a celebratory and auspicious dish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
<h2>For the Filling (Puran):</h2>
    <li>1 cup chana dal (split yellow gram)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup jaggery (or to taste), grated</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp cardamom powder</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg powder (optional)v
    <li>1 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)</li>
<h2>For the Dough:</h2>
    <li>1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp turmeric powder (optional, for color)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>Water (as needed to make dough)</li>
    <li>Ghee or oil for rolling and cooking</li>

        
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
       <h2>Step 1: Cook the Chana Dal</h2>
<li>Wash the chana dal thoroughly and cook it in a pressure cooker with enough water until it is soft (about 3-4 whistles).</li>
<li>Drain any excess water, but keep the dal moist.</li>
<h2>Step 2: Prepare the Filling (Puran)</h2>
<li>In a pan, heat 1 tbsp ghee.</li>
<li>Add the cooked chana dal and jaggery to the pan and mix well.</li>
<li>Cook this mixture on low heat, stirring continuously until the jaggery melts and combines with the dal.</li>
<li>Add cardamom powder and nutmeg powder (if using) to the mixture. Keep stirring until the mixture thickens to a paste-like consistency and begins to leave the sides of the pan.</li>
<li.Once the mixture is thick and smooth, remove from heat and allow it to cool.</li.
<h2>Step 3: Prepare the Dough</h2>
<li>In a large bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour (if using), turmeric powder, and salt.</h2>
<li>Gradually add water and knead into a smooth, soft dough. It should be soft but not sticky.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
<h2>Step 4: Make the Puran Poli</h2>
<li>Divide the dough into equal-sized balls.</li>
<li>Divide the puran (sweet filling) into portions the same size as the dough balls.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough ball into a small disc (about 3-4 inches in diameter).</li>
<li>Place the filling in the center of the dough disc and fold the edges over to seal the filling inside.</li>
<li>Gently roll out the stuffed dough ball into a larger circle, being careful not to let the filling spill out.</li>
<h2>Step 5: Cook the Puran Poli</h2>
<li>Heat a tawa or griddle on medium heat.</li>
<li>Place the rolled-out puran poli on the tawa and cook for about 1-2 minutes, or until small bubbles appear on the surface.</li.
<li>Flip it and cook the other side. Then, apply ghee or oil on both sides and cook until golden brown and crisp.</li>
<li>Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
<h2>Step 6: Serve</h2>
<li>Serve the puran poli hot, ideally with a dollop of ghee on top. It is often enjoyed with milk, yogurt, or a side of chutney.</li>

<h2>Enjoy your delicious puran poli!</h2>
