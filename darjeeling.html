    <h1>Darjeeling Tea Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Darjeeling Tea is one of the most famous and prized teas in the world, known for its distinct flavor, aroma, and high quality. Grown in the Darjeeling region of West Bengal, India, Darjeeling tea has earned the nickname "Champagne of teas" due to its delicate and complex flavors.
The history of Darjeeling tea dates back to the 19th century. The British colonial government introduced tea cultivation to the Darjeeling region in the early 1800s. The region’s cool climate, rich soil, and high altitudes provided ideal conditions for growing high-quality tea. In 1835, the first tea seeds were brought from China, and the first tea plantation was established.

Over time, Darjeeling tea became renowned globally, and its unique flavor profile was developed through a combination of environmental factors and cultivation techniques. The Darjeeling Tea industry flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with several estates, or tea gardens, being established in the region.

In 2004, Darjeeling tea received Geographical Indication (GI) status, which protected the name and ensured that only tea grown in the Darjeeling region could be labeled as "Darjeeling Tea."

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tea leaves: The leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant grown in the Darjeeling region.</li>
<li>Water: Fresh, filtered water is essential for brewing.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <h2>Water Temperature:</h2>

<li>For Black Darjeeling Tea, bring water to a near-boil, around 90-95°C (194-203°F).</li>
<li>For Green Darjeeling Tea, use slightly cooler water at around 75-85°C (167-185°F) to preserve the delicate flavors.</li>
<h2>Tea Leaves:</h2>

<li>Use 1 teaspoon of loose leaf tea per cup (approximately 250 ml or 8 oz) of water.</li>
<h2>Steeping:</h2>

<li>Black Tea: Steep for about 3-5 minutes. The longer you steep, the stronger the flavor, but avoid over-steeping, as it can turn bitter.</li>
<li>Green Tea: Steep for 2-3 minutes to retain the light, fresh flavor.</li>
<li>White Tea: Steep for 4-5 minutes, as it is more delicate and should not be brewed too long.</li>
<li>Oolong Tea: Steep for 3-4 minutes for a balance of flavor.</li>
<h2>Straining:</h2>

<li>Once the tea has steeped to your desired strength, strain the leaves and pour the tea into a cup.</li>
<h2>Serving:</h2>

<li>Darjeeling tea is traditionally served without milk or sugar, allowing the natural flavors to shine. However, some prefer adding a touch of lemon or honey, especially with green or white varieties.</li>
<li.It can also be enjoyed with a light snack, such as cookies or biscuits, in a traditional afternoon tea setting.</li>
