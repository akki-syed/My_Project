    <h1>Soma Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Soma was a ritual drink in ancient India, often mentioned in the Rigveda as a divine beverage. It was consumed during Vedic rituals and believed to grant immortality and divine inspiration to the drinker. Soma is described in the Rigveda as a divine elixir consumed by gods (Devas) and priests. It is associated with vitality, immortality, and a heightened state of awareness.
Mythology: Soma is also personified as a deity, revered as a god of plants, health, and immortality.
Rituals: The preparation, consumption, and offering of Soma were central to Vedic rituals. It was believed to bestow energy, inspiration, and spiritual enlightenment.
Original Ingredients (Speculative)
The exact composition of Soma is lost to history. Scholars and historians propose various theories:

Plants: Possible candidates include Ephedra, a plant with stimulant properties, and Amanita muscaria, a hallucinogenic mushroom.
Preparation: Soma was prepared by extracting juice from a plant (or plants), often mixed with water and other substances, then filtered through wool or grass.
Modern Interpretations
In contemporary times, Soma's historical recipe has been reimagined or symbolically recreated:

Substitute Plants: Non-intoxicating ingredients like milk, honey, and herbs (e.g., Tulsi or Ashwagandha) are sometimes used.
Symbolism: Soma is more commonly interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual bliss or divine consciousness, rather than a literal drink.
