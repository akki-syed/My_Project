    <h1>Shahi tukda Recipe</h1>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Shahi Tukda, meaning "Royal Piece," is a rich Mughlai dessert that traces its origins to the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire in India. This delicacy was considered a luxurious treat, combining fried bread with aromatic saffron milk and garnished with nuts. It reflects the culinary sophistication of the Mughal era, emphasizing indulgent flavors, textures, and the use of lavish ingredients like ghee, dry fruits, and silver or gold leaf for presentation.

Some food historians believe it may have been inspired by Middle Eastern desserts like Umm Ali or the Turkish Bread Pudding, adapted with local ingredients like ghee and cardamom. Today, it is a staple dessert during Ramadan and festive occasions in South Asia.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h2>For the Bread Base:</h2>
<li>Bread slices: 4-6 (preferably white bread)</li>
<li>Ghee: 4-5 tbsp (for frying)</li>
<h2>For the Rabri (Sweetened Condensed Milk):</h2>
<li>Full-fat milk: 1 liter</li>
<li>Sugar: 4-5 tbsp (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>Cardamom powder: 1/4 tsp</li>
<li>Saffron strands: 8-10 (soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk)</li>
<li>Rose water or kewra water: 1/2 tsp</li>
<h2>For the Sugar Syrup:</h2>
<li>Sugar: 1/2 cup</li>
<li>Water: 1/4 cup</li>
<li>Cardamom pods: 2-3</li>
<li>Lemon juice: 1/2 tsp (to prevent crystallization)</li>
<h2>For Garnish:</h2>
<li>Chopped nuts: Almonds, pistachios, and cashews (2-3 tbsp)</li>
<li>Silver leaf (optional): 1 sheet</li>
<li>Dried rose petals (optional): A few</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Rabri<h2>
<li>In a wide, heavy-bottomed pan, boil the milk over medium heat.</li>
<li>Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.</li>
<li>Scrape the sides to collect the cream and mix it into the milk.</li>
<li>When the milk reduces to half its original volume, add sugar, cardamom powder, and saffron milk.</li>
<li>Cook for another 10-15 minutes until the milk thickens to a creamy consistency.</li>
<li>Add rose or kewra water, mix well, and set aside to cool.</li>
<h2>Step 2: Prepare the Bread</h2>
<li>Cut the bread slices into triangles or squares, removing the crusts.</li>
<li>Heat ghee in a frying pan and fry the bread pieces until golden brown and crisp.</li>
<li>Place the fried bread on a paper towel to drain excess ghee.</li>
<h2>Step 3: Make the Sugar Syrup</h2>
<li>Combine sugar, water, and cardamom pods in a pan.</li>
<li>Heat until the sugar dissolves completely, and boil for 2-3 minutes to form a slightly sticky syrup.</li>
<li>Add lemon juice to stabilize the syrup and set it aside.</li>
<h2>Step 4: Assemble the Shahi Tukda</h2>
<li>Dip each fried bread piece into the warm sugar syrup for a few seconds, ensuring it's coated but not soggy.</li>
<li>Arrange the sugar-coated bread pieces on a serving plate.</li>
<li>Pour the prepared rabri generously over the bread.</li>
<h2>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h2>
<li>Garnish with chopped nuts, a drizzle of saffron milk, and dried rose petals.</li>
<li>If desired, place a sheet of edible silver leaf on top for an authentic royal touch.</li>
<li>Chill for 1-2 hours or serve warm as preferred.</li>
<h2>Enjoy this decadent dessert fit for royalty! ðŸ¥°</h2>
